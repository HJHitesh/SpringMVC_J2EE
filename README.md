# Employee Management System

This is a simple Employee Management System implemented using Spring Boot. The application provides CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for managing employee records. The system includes features like adding, updating, deleting, and searching for employees, and validates input data before submission.

## Features

- **Home Page**: Displays a list of all employees.
- **Add Employee**: A form to add a new employee.
- **Search Employee**: Allows searching employees by their name or department.
- **Update Employee**: Allows updating an existing employee's information.
- **Delete Employee**: Allows deleting an employee from the list.

## Technologies Used

- **Spring Boot**: Framework used for building the application.
- **Validation**: Ensures proper form submission with validation annotations (like `@NotEmpty`, `@Email`, `@Positive`).
- **Java**: Programming language used for back-end logic.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- Java 11 or later installed.
- Maven or Gradle (depending on your build tool).
- An IDE like IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse to run the application.
